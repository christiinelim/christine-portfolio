                        As a science student, I was lucky to be exposed to a programming module during my undergraduate year. 
                        I found it very interesting as I have to consistently think of how to approach a case logically.
                        This was where I knew I may have an interest in Tech. It was however always in the back of my mind where I had a lot of what if I had joined a computing related course.
                        In my final year project, the project that involved web development instantly stood out to me.
                        I was very excited to be once again expose to the field of tech and I was able to challenge myself by picking up new languages and developing a website on my own.
                        This positive experience further propelled my interest further and I am now making a bold decision to switch industry.
